# Tamagotchi PetGame

Inspired by the popularity of the Tamagotchi gadgets of the early 2000s, my version of the Tamagotchi pet game consists of not-so-common pets like koalas, dolphins, and rabbits. Each pet has its own unique talent which will cost it either energy or hunger at a much signficant rate as opposed to common activities. Due to the nature of this game, there isn't a specific "winning" or "losing" condition but the game will end if the animal is starved.
